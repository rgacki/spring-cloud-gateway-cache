# Cache for Spring Cloud Gateway
Adds HTTP cache capabilities to Spring Cloud Gateway.

# Motivation
My motivations are:
1) Be able to replace the Dispatcher in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) projects.
2) Work with Spring Cloud Gateway and its reactive API.
3) Learn more about HTTP-compliant caching.

# Vision
Implement a cache for Spring Cloud Gateway, which works out-of-the-box, is configurable and extensible.
